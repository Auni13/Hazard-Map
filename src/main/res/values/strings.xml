    <string name="info">A danger is something that has the potential to cause damage, harm, or adverse health effects to something or someone. A hazard is the potential for harm or an undesirable impact, such as injury to people through health effects, harm to organisations through property or equipment losses, or harm to the environment. Being aware of any potential threats can help us stay healthy and avoid damage or illness. We must be aware of our surroundings and recognise potential hazards and harmful circumstances. You are unlikely to detect danger if you are unaware of it.</string>
